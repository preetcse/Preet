## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Error: "credentials.json not found"
- **Solution**: Make sure `credentials.json` is in the same folder as `app.py`

### Error: "redirect_uri_mismatch"
- **Solution**: In Google Cloud Console, ensure redirect URI is exactly:
  `http://localhost:5000/google_callback`

### Error: "access_denied"
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check OAuth consent screen is configured
  2. Add your email as test user
  3. Make sure you're signed in with the correct Google account

### Error: "invalid_client"
- **Solution**: Re-download credentials.json from Google Cloud Console

### Can't access localhost:5000
- **Solution**: 
  1. Make sure Python app is running
  2. Check no other service is using port 5000
  3. Try: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead

## ðŸ“± Mobile Access Setup

If you want to access from your phone on the same network:

1. **Find your computer's IP address**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   ip addr show | grep inet
   
   # On Windows
   ipconfig
   ```

2. **Update redirect URI in Google Cloud**
   - Add: `http://YOUR-IP:5000/google_callback`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000/google_callback`

3. **Run app on all interfaces**
   ```bash
   # Modify app.py last line to:
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

## ðŸ’¾ Storage Information

- **Free Storage**: 15GB on Google Drive
- **File Organization**: All bills stored in "Amarjit Electrical Store" folder
- **File Access**: All uploaded images are viewable from Google Drive
- **Backup**: Your Google Drive automatically backs up all files

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Your `credentials.json` contains sensitive information
- Never share this file publicly
- The app only requests permission to create and read files it uploads
- Google OAuth is highly secure and used by millions of apps

## âœ… Verification Steps

After setup, verify everything works:

1. âœ… Application starts without errors
2. âœ… Can access http://localhost:5000
3. âœ… Can create admin account
4. âœ… "Connect Google Drive" shows success message
5. âœ… Sidebar shows "Drive Connected"
6. âœ… Can add a customer
7. âœ… Can upload a bill image when recording transaction
8. âœ… Can view uploaded image from transaction history

## ðŸ†˜ Still Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the application output** - Look for error messages in the terminal
2. **Verify all steps** - Make sure each step above was completed
3. **Check file permissions** - Ensure `credentials.json` is readable
4. **Try fresh setup** - Delete `credentials.json` and start over

**Remember**: Google Drive integration is optional. The app works fine without it, you just won't be able to store bill images in the cloud.
