# ðŸ”§ Google OAuth HTTPS Fix - "insecure_transport" Error

## Problem Fixed âœ…
Error: `(insecure_transport) OAuth 2 MUST utilize https`

## What Was the Issue?
- Google OAuth 2.0 requires HTTPS by default
- Our app runs on HTTP (localhost:5000) for development
- Google blocked the OAuth flow for security

## Solution Applied âœ…
Added this line to `app.py`:
```python
# Fix for development - allow insecure transport for localhost
os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'] = '1'
```

## âœ… Now Google Drive Works!

### Test Steps:
1. **Go to your app**: http://localhost:5000
2. **Login with your admin account**
3. **Click "Connect Google Drive"**
4. **You should see Google's permission screen** (not the error)
5. **Add yourself as test user** if you see the 403 error (see GOOGLE_OAUTH_FIX.md)
6. **Click "Allow"**
7. **Success!** âœ…

## ðŸ”’ Security Note
- This fix is **ONLY for development** on localhost
- **Never use this in production** with a real domain
- For production, you need proper HTTPS/SSL certificates
- For your electrical store use (localhost), this is perfectly safe

## ðŸ†˜ If Still Having Issues

4. **Test user added**: Your email in OAuth consent screen
5. **Credentials file**: `credentials.json` in project folder

### Error Messages:
- **"credentials.json not found"** â†’ Check file exists in same folder as app.py
